# SND

Personal project, Mac OS audio player with tabs inspired by foobar2000.

This is a ground-up rework of my [old player](https://github.com/r-ss/SND.legacy) written in 2013.
But now in Swift and SwiftUI for latest MacOS

As a file-based audio playes, there is no metatags, collections by artist etc. Playlists shows only filename and track duration. Intentionally.

I am accepting pull requests.

## TODO:
- Change volume by dragging slider, not just clicking
- Add more tests
