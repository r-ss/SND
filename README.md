# SND

Personal project, Mac OS audio player with tabs inspired by foobar2000.

This is a ground-up rework of my [old player](https://github.com/r-ss/SND.legacy) written in 2013.
But now in Swift and SwiftUI for latest MacOS

I am accepting pull requests!

## TODO:
- Tabs
- Track duration column in playlist
- Saving plalist state between app launches
- Change volume by dragging slider, not just clicking
